[![INFORMS Annual Meeting 2020: "Manufacturing Productivity with Worker Turnover"](https://i.imgur.com/5M3KoOL.png)](https://vimeo.com/483399116)

A brief overview and history of worker turnover, followed by a discussion of new findings from studies using supply chain worker data in collaboration with the Apple Worker Exit Study: (1) Turnover's negative effects arise primarily by disrupting workgroup relationships, instead of from the loss of experience alone. (2) The effects are significant. (3) Workers' incentives can be designed to effectively control---in contrast to operational measures that buffer against---operationally disruptive worker turnover.
