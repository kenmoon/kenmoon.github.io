This 4th webinar in the 4-part Analytics at Wharton Series explores the phenomena of worker turnover and burnout which have grown increasingly prevalent as firms, marketplaces, and institutions become more flexible and adaptive. Drawing from some of the world?s largest factories to its most sophisticated intensive care units, what can data analytics tell us about this challenge, and can it show us a better path forward? Eric Bradlow, Vice Dean of Analytics, K.P. Chao Professor, Professor of Marketing, Statistics, Education and Economics and Chairperson Wharton Marketing Department will moderate Q&A.
