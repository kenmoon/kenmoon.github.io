[![INFORMS Annual Meeting 2020: "Matching in Online Marketplaces When Talent Is Difficult to Discern"](https://i.imgur.com/dDAq3C3.png)](https://vimeo.com/483401680)

A discussion of online labor marketplaces for services where quality in the form of skills, adaptability, and reliability are highly valued.  Studies have shown that employers/clients in such online marketplaces fail to share quality information about workers (e.g., via ratings and reviews) that is known to them and valuable to the platform and other prospective employers.  We first propose new empirical methods to measure the value of such information and then explore implications for matching.
